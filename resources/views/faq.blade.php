                                                <p>Normally, your country number won’t work here in Myanmar.

                                                    You can however easily buy SIM cards at every airport and in all major cities. There are three operators: MPT, Ooredoo, and Telenor. You are recommended to use MPT because it is the only operator with the largest network coverage. You can also surf the net using Wifi offered at your hotels, some restaurants, or Internet cafes. Please be noted that internet connections are slow.
                                                    
                                                    Note: Please, you can request to our travel consultant and sales reps to prepare SIM card for your in advance.</p>

                                                    Official Exchange Counters are available at most airports and in the downtown area of major cities. You are highly recommended to change your money at official exchange counters so you can achieve the best exchange rate.
                                                    
                                                    What you can change at Official Exchange Counters are USD, SGD, and EUR.
                                                    
                                                    One of much good news for tourists visiting Myanmar is “You can now withdraw money with your Credit Card”. You can withdraw your money at CB Bank, KBZ and MOB’s ATMs. But, you can withdraw only Myanmar currency (Kyats) at the exchange rate of the day.

                                                <P>We expose culture tourism as our country’s primary tourism and is, to a great extent, influenced by Buddhism. So, when you visit religious places and holy ground, you are supposed to cover your knee and shoulders, especially for women.

                                                <br>    As you have to walk barefoot most of the time when visiting pagodas and monasteries, we recommend you to wear a slipper/sandal.But it is a great experience to flow with the culture of the country you are visiting.</P>

                                                <p>Burmese cuisine is unique, owing to the geographic location of Myanmar, Burmese cuisine has been influenced by China, India, and Thailand. The diversity of Myanmar’s cuisine has also been contributed to by the myriad of local ethnic minorities. Burmese cuisine is characterized by extensive use of fish products like fish sauce and ngapi (fermented seafood). Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads, centered on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, kaffir lime, laphat (pickled tea leaves), and ngapi (fish paste). These salads have always been popular as fast foods.</p>
